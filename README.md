# Go-lOra-iot-Dashboard

## Overview
Welcome to the Go-lOra-iot-Dashboard project repository! This project was developed as part of a school project. It involves using a FiPy module and a temperature sensor to create a LoRaWAN IoT sensor. Additionally, a dashboard is created to visualize the data received from the sensor through an MQTT server.

## Features
- **FiPy Module Integration**: Utilizes the FiPy module for wireless communication.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Collects temperature data from the environment.
- **LoRaWAN Connectivity**: Establishes a LoRaWAN connection for data transmission.
- **MQTT Server**: Facilitates communication between the sensor and the dashboard.
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Displays real-time data received from the sensor in a user-friendly dashboard interface.

## Dependencies
- FiPy Module Libraries
- MQTT Library
